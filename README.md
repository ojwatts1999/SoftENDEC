# SoftENDEC
Batch EAS Encoder

Hello!
This is a sort of FAQ type thing:
Q: Why is it called SoftENDEC?
A: Idk, I think it means Encoder Decoder when it doesn't decode, so a more realistic name would be SoftENCODE.

Q: How do I download?
A: Find the version you want in the branches, and then download as a ZIP.
