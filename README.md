Hello!

FAQ:

Q: SmartScreen is blocking this app from running. Is this a virus?

A: NO. It is not a virus. That is a false positive. Press "More Info" and then "Run anyway" if you experience this issue.

Q: Why is it called SoftENDEC?


A: Idk, I think it means Encoder Decoder when it doesn't decode, so a more realistic name would be SoftENCODE.


Q: How do I download?


A: Find the version you want in the branches, and then download as a ZIP.
